This\ntemplate shows how instructors can easily create interactive web\ndocuments that students can use in self-guided learning.\n\nThe `{webexercises}` package provides a number of functions that you use\nin [inline R\ncode](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)\nor through code chunk options to create HTML widgets (text boxes, pull\ndown menus, buttons that reveal hidden content). Examples are given\nbelow. Render this file to HTML to see how it works.\n\n**NOTE: To use the widgets in the compiled HTML file, you need to have a\nJavaScript-enabled browser.**\n\n## Example Questions\n\n### Fill-In-The-Blanks (`fitb()`)\n\nCreate fill-in-the-blank questions using `fitb()`, providing the answer\nas the first argument.\n\n-   2 + 2 is <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='1' data-answer='[\"4\"]'/>\n\nYou can also create these questions dynamically, using variables from\nyour R session.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n-   The square root of 25 is: <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='1' data-answer='[\"5\"]'/>\n\nThe blanks are case-sensitive; if you don't care about case, use the\nargument `ignore_case = TRUE`.\n\n-   What is the letter after D? <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"E\"]'/>\n\nIf you want to ignore differences in whitespace use, use the argument\n`ignore_ws = TRUE` (which is the default) and include spaces in your\nanswer anywhere they could be acceptable.\n\n-   How do you load the tidyverse package?\n    <input class='webex-solveme nospaces' size='20' data-answer='[\"library( tidyverse )\",\"library( \\\"tidyverse\\\" )\",\"library( &apos;tidyverse&apos; )\"]'/>\n\nYou can set more than one possible correct answer by setting the answers\nas a vector.\n\n-   Type a vowel:\n    <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='1' data-answer='[\"A\",\"E\",\"I\",\"O\",\"U\"]'/>\n\nYou can use regular expressions to test answers against more complex\nrules.\n\n-   Type any 3 letters:\n    <input class='webex-solveme nospaces regex' size='3' data-answer='[\"^[a-zA-Z]{3}$\"]'/>\n\n### Multiple Choice (`mcq()`)\n\n-   \"Never gonna give you up, never gonna:\n    <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value=''>let you go</option><option value=''>turn you down</option><option value=''>run away</option><option value='answer'>let you down</option></select>\"\n-   \"I\n    <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>bless the rains</option><option value=''>guess it rains</option><option value=''>sense the rain</option></select>\n    down in Africa\" -Toto\n\n### True or False (`torf()`)\n\n-   True or False? You can permute values in a vector using `sample()`.\n    <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>\n\n### Longer MCQs (`longmcq()`)\n\nWhen your answers are very long, sometimes a drop-down select box gets\nformatted oddly. You can use `longmcq()` to deal with this. Since the\nanswers are long, It's probably best to set up the options inside an R\nchunk with `echo=FALSE`.\n\n**What is a p-value?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_FVGWQEZIWB'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FVGWQEZIWB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>the probability that the null hypothesis is true</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FVGWQEZIWB\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_FVGWQEZIWB\" value=\"\"></input> <span>the probability of making an error in your conclusion</span></label></div>\n\n\n**What is true about a 95% confidence interval of the mean?**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n<div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_YMGAPLGVXX'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_YMGAPLGVXX\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>if you repeated the process many times, 95% of intervals calculated in this way contain the true mean</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_YMGAPLGVXX\" value=\"\"></input> <span>there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies within this range</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_YMGAPLGVXX\" value=\"\"></input> <span>95% of the data fall within this range</span></label></div>\n\n\n## Checked sections\n\nCreate sections with the class `webex-check` to add a button that hides\nfeedback until it is pressed. Add the class `webex-box` to draw a box\naround the section (or use your own styles).\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\nI am going to learn a lot: <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select>\n\nWhat is a p-value? <div class='webex-radiogroup' id='radio_LKZVFKIINY'><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_LKZVFKIINY\" value=\"\"></input> <span>the probability that the null hypothesis is true</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_LKZVFKIINY\" value=\"answer\"></input> <span>the probability of the observed, or more extreme, data, under the assumption that the null-hypothesis is true</span></label><label><input type=\"radio\" autocomplete=\"off\" name=\"radio_LKZVFKIINY\" value=\"\"></input> <span>the probability of making an error in your conclusion</span></label></div>\n:::\n\n## Hidden solutions and hints\n\nYou can fence off a solution area that will be hidden behind a button\nusing `hide()` before the solution and `unhide()` after, each as inline\nR code. Pass the text you want to appear on the button to the `hide()`\nfunction.\n\nIf the solution is a code chunk, instead of using `hide()` and\n`unhide()`, simply set the `webex.hide` chunk option to TRUE, or set it\nto the string you wish to display on the button.\n\n**Recreate the scatterplot below, using the built-in `cars` dataset.**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](webexercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>I need a hint</button>\n\n\nSee the documentation for `plot()` (`?plot`)\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<!-- note: you could also just set webex.hide to TRUE -->\n\n\n::: {.cell webex.hide='Click here to see the solution'}\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Click here to see the solution</button>\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(cars$speed, cars$dist)\n```\n\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Psychology of Deception: Web Exercises\"\n---\n\n\n\nThis set of exercises will test your knowledge about various aspects of\ndeception in psychology.

The tendency for people to believe they are less likely to be\n    deceived than others is known as the\n    <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='27' data-answer='[\"illusion of invulnerability\",\"invulnerability illusion\"]'/>\n    to deception.\n\n2.  In deception research, the\n    <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='11' data-answer='[\"confederate\"]'/> is an actor who works\n    with the experimenter to deceive the actual participant.\n\n3.  The <input class='webex-solveme nospaces ignorecase' size='14' data-answer='[\"Duchenne smile\",\"Duchenne\"]'/> is\n    a genuine smile that involves both the mouth and the eyes, making it\n    harder to fake in deceptive situations.\n\n## Multiple Choice\n\n1.

Many common beliefs about deception cues (e.g., lack of eye contact)\n    are not reliable indicators.\n2.  Liars often strategically control their behavior to appear truthful.\n3.  Individual differences in baseline behavior make it hard to identify\n    deviations.\n4.  The cognitive load of trying to detect lies can impair judgment.\n5.  Confirmation bias can lead people to interpret ambiguous cues in\n    line with their expectations.\n\n\n</div>\n\n:::\n\n## Hidden solutions and hints\n\n**A researcher wants to study how cognitive load affects lying behavior.\nDescribe a potential experimental design to investigate this.**\n\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>I need a hint</button>\n\n\nConsider how you might manipulate cognitive load (e.g., through a\nsecondary task) and measure lying behavior. Think about what control\nconditions you might need.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n::: {.cell webex.hide='Click here to see a possible experimental design'}\n\n<div class='webex-solution'><button>Click here to see a possible experimental design</button>\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Possible Experimental Design:\n\n# Participants: 100 adults randomly assigned to two groups (50 each)\n# \n# Procedure:\n# 1. All participants are asked to lie about a recent experience\n# \n# 2. Experimental group: \n#    - Must count backwards from 100 by 7s while lying (high cognitive load)\n# \n# 3. Control group:\n#    - Simply lie without additional task (normal cognitive load)\n# \n# 4. Measure dependent variables:\n#    - Speech hesitations\n#    - Speech rate\n#    - Amount of detail provided\n#    - Perceived believability (rated by independent judges)\n# \n# 5. Compare measures between groups to assess the effect of cognitive load on lying behavior\n\n# This design allows us to isolate the effect of increased cognitive load on various aspects of lying behavior.\n```\n\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n\nThis set of exercises covers various aspects of deception psychology,\nincluding theories, research methods, and key findings.
