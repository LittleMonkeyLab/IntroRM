The visual elements should guide the viewer through a narrative—showing change over time, revealing relationships, or highlighting key insights.\nApplication:\nCase studies or reports where data unfolds in a logical, easy-to-follow sequence, such as telling the story of a community’s health or an individual’s progress.\nExample:\nAn interactive webpage showing the impact of social media on mental health through a narrative of personal experiences and trends."

They are visually engaging, often using illustrations, icons, and small amounts of data to convey key points at a glance.\nApplication:\nIdeal for social media, brochures, or posters where quick digestion of information is needed. Frequently used in public campaigns, marketing, and education.\nExample:\nAn infographic explaining the psychology of sleep, showing how sleep cycles work and tips to improve sleep habits."

They allow users to interact with the data, filter information, and explore different aspects on demand.\nApplication:\nUseful in business, healthcare, or education where decision-makers need up-to-date, actionable insights. Dashboards can provide an overview of research data, employee performance, or patient metrics.\nExample:\nA live dashboard tracking the results of a clinical trial, showing participant progress, side effects, and key outcome measures."

It communicates complex ideas through artistic mediums, helping people emotionally connect with the data.\nApplication:\nUseful in public exhibitions, museums, or campaigns designed to evoke emotional responses. Can be particularly impactful when the goal is to inspire action or reflection.\nExample:\nA visual installation representing the world’s most polluted cities, where the intensity of color and shape corresponds to pollution levels."

This method is perfect for exploring complex datasets where users need control over what they want to see.\nExample:\nA web tool where users can explore the effects of different factors (e.g., age, gender, education) on job satisfaction."
