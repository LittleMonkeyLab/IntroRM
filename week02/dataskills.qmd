# DataSkills Homework: Wellbeing Measurement Challenge

::: callout-tip
### Group Submission Overview:

As a group, you will submit a **balanced and evaluative** report on the
following four components. The goal is for your group to collaborate and
submit a cohesive piece that documents any **disagreements** or
different perspectives. The submission doesn't have to be perfect, but
it should reflect thoughtful discussion and analysis.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Key Reference (Journal Article or Data)

Your group will identify a **key reference** (a journal article or
dataset) that you believe is foundational or highly relevant to the
topic of **wellbeing measurement**.

-   **Why this reference?** What makes this reference central to the
    topic?
-   **How does it support** the understanding or measurement of
    wellbeing?

::: callout-important
*Tip*: Make sure to clearly cite the reference and provide a brief
summary of its relevance.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Preferred Measurement Approach

Discuss as a group and agree on a **preferred measurement approach** for
wellbeing. This could be one of the scales or frameworks you encountered
in the lab (e.g., the **Life Satisfaction Survey**, the **PERMA model**,
etc.).

-   **Positives**: What are the strengths of this approach?
-   **Negatives**: What are its limitations or potential biases?

::: callout-note
*Important*: You don’t have to agree entirely! Document any
**disagreements** or varied perspectives within your group. This is part
of the evaluative process.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Wellbeing Intervention Plan

Design a **simple intervention** that could improve a particular
dimension of wellbeing (mental, social, or physical).

-   **What is your intervention?** Describe it briefly.
-   **Which dimension of wellbeing** does it target?
-   **How will you implement it?** Outline any key steps for success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Defining Success & Expected Outcomes

-   **What does success look like** for your intervention? Be as
    specific as possible.
-   **Do you think your intervention will be successful?** Discuss
    whether the group believes it can achieve the desired outcomes, and
    why.

::: callout-warning
*Reminder*: It’s okay to be **realistic** about potential challenges or
limitations—documenting uncertainty or differing viewpoints is
encouraged.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Individual Submission: Weekly Reflection

Each individual in the group must submit a brief personal **reflection**
on the week's activities. This is your opportunity to document your own
learning, thoughts, and any disagreements or insights you had while
working with your group.

### Reflection Prompt:

-   What were your key takeaways from this week's activities?
-   Did anything surprise you or challenge your understanding of
    wellbeing?
-   How did working with your group influence your perspective?

::: callout-tip
*Submission Tip*: Be honest about your learning process! This reflection
should be personal and thoughtful.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Submission Guidelines

-   Your **group submission** can be turned in whenever your group feels
    ready, but aim for a balanced, thoughtful evaluation.
-   You can choose **how** you submit it (written report, slides, video,
    etc.), but ensure it's clear and cohesive.
-   **Individual reflections** should be submitted alongside the group
    work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Good luck, and remember: It’s not about perfection—it’s about learning
and engaging with the process!
