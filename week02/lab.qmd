## Chapter 1: Wellbeing Measurement Challenge

::: callout-important
### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

*"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of
giants."* — Isaac Newton

Before diving into your first lab, you've had a week to explore some key
aspects of **wellbeing**. The work of pioneers in psychology and
wellbeing research, such as **Martin Seligman** and **Ed Diener**, has
shaped the field you're about to engage with. In this chapter, we'll
guide you through core concepts, helping you build on their successes
while avoiding common pitfalls.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. What is Wellbeing? (15 minutes)

### Concept Overview:

Wellbeing is **multidimensional**, involving emotional, psychological,
social, and physical components. By understanding these different
dimensions, we can more accurately measure and improve wellbeing.

-   **Emotional Wellbeing**: Feelings of happiness and satisfaction
-   **Psychological Wellbeing**: Purpose, self-acceptance, and growth
-   **Social Wellbeing**: Relationships and community belonging

**Key Question**: Which dimensions of wellbeing have researchers focused
on, and why?

::: callout-tip
#### Giants in the Field:

-   **Martin Seligman**'s **PERMA Model** (Positive Emotion, Engagement,
    Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment)
-   **Ed Diener**'s work on **Subjective Wellbeing**
:::

**Takeaway**: - **Success**: These models provide a comprehensive
framework to explore wellbeing. - **Caution**: Beware of
**over-simplifying** wellbeing—it’s not just about happiness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Measuring Wellbeing (30 minutes)

### Activity Overview:

You will complete several measures that assess different aspects of your
wellbeing.

**Common Wellbeing Measures**: - **Life Satisfaction Survey** (by
Diener) - **Emotional Wellbeing Scale** - **Flourishing Scale**

### Key Terminology:

-   **Reliability**: Does the measure consistently capture what it’s
    supposed to?
-   **Validity**: Does it actually measure wellbeing, or is it capturing
    something else?

::: callout-note
#### Reflection:

What did you think about the different measures? Did they capture your
wellbeing accurately? How did they make you feel?
:::

**What the Giants Have Achieved**: - **Strength**: These scales are
**scientifically validated**, with a strong track record. - **Potential
Pitfalls**: They can be too **general** or **culturally biased**. What
can you add to future measures?

::: callout-warning
**Looking Ahead**: In future labs, you'll learn more about
**psychometrics**—the science of measuring psychological traits like
wellbeing. You’ll also explore how to test the **validity** and
**reliability** of these measures in your own research.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Designing Wellbeing Interventions (30 minutes)

### Group Activity Overview:

Design a **simple wellbeing intervention** that could improve one of the
dimensions of wellbeing.

### Key Questions:

-   What issue is your intervention addressing? Is it mental, physical,
    or social wellbeing?
-   How will you measure its effectiveness?

**Example Interventions**: - A daily **gratitude practice**
(Psychological Wellbeing) - A **social support network** for peers
(Social Wellbeing)

::: callout-tip
#### Giants’ Wisdom:

-   **Strength**: Research has shown that small changes can make a big
    impact, like the **power of gratitude** (Seligman).
-   **Common Pitfalls**: Many interventions fail because they are too
    **difficult** to implement in the real world. Keep it simple and
    practical.
:::

**Looking Ahead**: Later in your course, you will learn how to develop
and test interventions more formally, using **experimental designs** and
**data analysis** to prove their effectiveness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Money and Happiness: The Relationship (30 minutes)

### Concept Overview:

Research shows that while **money can buy happiness** to an extent, it
has **diminishing returns**.

### Key Terminology:

-   **Diminishing Marginal Returns**: Beyond a certain point, each extra
    unit of money brings less additional happiness.

### Activity:

-   Plot your own hypothesis of the money-happiness relationship. How do
    you think **income** relates to happiness?

::: callout-note
#### What Giants Have Found:

-   **Strength**: Research like **Kahneman and Deaton’s** work shows a
    clear threshold (\~\$75,000).
-   **Common Error**: Focusing too much on income while ignoring other
    key factors, like **relationships** or **health**.
:::

**Looking Ahead**: You’ll soon dive deeper into **economic psychology**
and how subjective factors, like **perception** and **expectations**,
play a role in happiness and wellbeing.

## 5. Critical Analysis of Wellbeing Measures (15 minutes)

### Activity:

Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the wellbeing measures you’ve
used. - Were they easy to understand? - Did they capture the
**complexity** of wellbeing? - Would you trust them in your own
research?

::: callout-important
#### Giants’ Learnings:

-   **Success**: Existing scales have been rigorously tested for
    **validity** and **reliability**.
-   **Caution**: Be critical of whether these scales can be applied to
    **different populations**. A measure that works well in the UK might
    not translate well to other cultures.
:::

**Looking Ahead**: Next, you’ll explore how to conduct your own
**critical reviews** of research, building the skills to assess
strengths and weaknesses in published studies.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Conclusion and Reflection (15 minutes)

### Key Points:

-   Wellbeing is **multifaceted** and should be approached from multiple
    angles.
-   Measurement tools are useful but not flawless—be mindful of their
    limitations.
-   Small interventions can make a big difference, but they must be
    **practical**.

### Next Steps:

-   Continue exploring different **measures** of wellbeing in future
    labs.
-   Develop your own **intervention projects**, and learn how to
    **evaluate their success**.
-   Apply critical thinking when assessing research and start thinking
    about your own **research designs**.

### Final Reflection Prompt:

What insights from today will you take into your own work? How will you
use the knowledge of **giants** in this field to inform your own
approach?
