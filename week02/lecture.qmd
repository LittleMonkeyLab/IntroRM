## Uncovering Truths

-   Curiosity
-   Questions
-   Measurements
-   Data
-   Tools
-   Creativity
-   Hard-thinking

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Welcome to University!

-   You've had an exciting first week.
-   The big question of Well-being:
    -   What is it?
    -   How do you measure it?
    -   How do we increase it?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Positive Psychology

-   Using the power of your mind to achieve positive things.
-   And now, you've got me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

-   I'll take these first two lectures, labs, and data skills sessions.
-   We'll explore life outcomes, well-being, success, happiness, and
    Positive Psychology.
-   We'll dive into Positive Research Methods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Big Setup

-   One day, you'll want to change a mind, capture interest, persuade,
    convince, or motivate.
-   It could be an idea, a product, a pitch, or even a truth.
-   I want you to be ready for that moment.
-   Practice now on ideas and data that aren't life-changing... yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A World of Ideas

-   The world is your repertoire.
-   This is a psychology module, but let's avoid talking about
    psychology today.
-   Let's avoid numbers too!
-   And most importantly, let's avoid being boring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

-   Who said that?\
-   \[Pause for class participation\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decision Making

-   What do I want to communicate?
-   What's the best way to communicate that?\
-   Is it risky?\
-   Should I talk, show, demonstrate?
-   Should I pretend to be an expert or show my failures?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## This Week & Next: Data Visualisation

-   Data Visualisation I & II.
-   **Did I inspire wonder?**
    -   What if I had chosen a different title?
        -   Truth, Beauty, and Power
        -   Seeing is Believing: The Power of Data Visualization in
            Psychology
        -   From Data to Drama: The Art of Psychological Storytelling

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## End Visualisation

-   People don't like to be shown where they are; they like to see the
    destination.
-   Disneyland: "15 miles" vs "Only 15 minutes!"
-   Shampoo: "For Frizzy, Dry Hair" vs "Smooth n' Sleek"
-   Are you derivative, boring, 'grey' or will you **Think Different**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Positive Research Methods

-   **Marcus Aurelius**: "Master your mind, accept your fate, and act
    with virtue."
-   **Aristotle**: "Live a balanced life guided by reason, virtue, and
    the pursuit of flourishing."
-   **Jagger**: "You can't always get what you want, but sometimes you
    get what you need."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dream Big

-   Do you have a dream?
-   Do you **need** a dream?

## **Why Visualize Data?**

-   Visuals help us **perceive patterns** and **relationships** between
    variables.

-   In psychology, this is critical when studying associations like:

    -   Age and cognition

    -   Stress and health

-   A well-designed graph can uncover insights missed by **numerical
    summaries** alone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Cognitive Bias and Visualization**

-   Graphs tap into human **visual perception**: how we process shapes,
    contrasts, and relationships.

-   But be cautious! Our perception can also **mislead**:

    -   **Outliers** can skew interpretations.

    -   Complex designs (like 3D graphs) can distort reality.

-   Example: Anscombe’s Quartet — same statistics, but radically
    different scatterplots.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Visual Tasks in Psychology**

-   In psychology, we often ask questions like:

    -   **Is there a pattern?**

    -   **Is there a correlation?**

-   Scatterplots, bar charts, and line graphs help us **visually
    decode** relationships faster than raw data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Designing Honest Graphs**

-   The aim is to **present data truthfully**:

    -   Avoid chartjunk or misleading embellishments.

    -   Keep the focus on the **data**, not the decoration.

-   In psychology, we need clarity to avoid **misleading
    conclusions** about human behavior and cognition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Perception and Human Cognition**

-   Our minds tend to **group visual data** (Gestalt principles).

    -   This can help but also mislead.

-   Example: **Stacked bar charts** can obscure individual trends within
    groups.

    -   Be mindful of what you're trying to communicate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Plato’s Triad: The True, The Good, and The Beautiful**

Plato believed in the intrinsic connection between **truth**,
**goodness**, and **beauty** — a concept that has influenced Western
thought for centuries.

For Plato, these three qualities are inseparable in the realm of
**Forms**.

The **truth** is inherently **good**, and what is **good** is also
inherently **beautiful**.

Thus, if something is **false**, it cannot be truly **beautiful** or
**good**.
