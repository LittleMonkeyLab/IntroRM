## Data Visualization Beyond Graphs

### More than Just Charts **\[***noun\]* /ˈdeɪtə vɪʒuəlɪˈzeɪʃən/

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Data as Stories

**Concept:**\
Data visualization isn't just about numbers; it's about telling a
compelling story. The visual elements should guide the viewer through a
narrative—showing change over time, revealing relationships, or
highlighting key insights.

**Application:**\
Case studies or reports where data unfolds in a logical, easy-to-follow
sequence, such as telling the story of a community's health or an
individual's progress.

**Example:**\
An interactive webpage showing the impact of social media on mental
health through a narrative of personal experiences and trends.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Infographics

**Concept:**\
Infographics combine text, visuals, and data to create a highly
accessible, single-view communication tool. They are visually engaging,
often using illustrations, icons, and small amounts of data to convey
key points at a glance.

**Application:**\
Ideal for social media, brochures, or posters where quick digestion of
information is needed. Frequently used in public campaigns, marketing,
and education.

**Example:**\
An infographic explaining the psychology of sleep, showing how sleep
cycles work and tips to improve sleep habits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Animations

**Concept:**\
Animations bring data to life by adding movement, showing how data
evolves over time or revealing complex processes step-by-step. They are
effective in capturing attention and illustrating dynamic changes.

**Application:**\
Excellent for presentations, video content, or interactive dashboards.
Can be used in education to break down complex processes (e.g., brain
activity) or in marketing to show trends over time.

**Example:**\
An animated chart showing the rise of global temperatures over decades,
or an animation walking through the steps of a psychological experiment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Dashboards

**Concept:**\
Dashboards provide a comprehensive, real-time view of data, often
integrating multiple graphs and charts into one interface. They allow
users to interact with the data, filter information, and explore
different aspects on demand.

**Application:**\
Useful in business, healthcare, or education where decision-makers need
up-to-date, actionable insights. Dashboards can provide an overview of
research data, employee performance, or patient metrics.

**Example:**\
A live dashboard tracking the results of a clinical trial, showing
participant progress, side effects, and key outcome measures.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Data-Driven Art

**Concept:**\
Data-driven art turns data into creative visual expressions, where
aesthetics and meaning are equally important. It communicates complex
ideas through artistic mediums, helping people emotionally connect with
the data.

**Application:**\
Useful in public exhibitions, museums, or campaigns designed to evoke
emotional responses. Can be particularly impactful when the goal is to
inspire action or reflection.

**Example:**\
A visual installation representing the world’s most polluted cities,
where the intensity of color and shape corresponds to pollution levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Interactive Visualizations

**Concept:**\
Interactive visualizations allow the audience to explore the data
themselves. Users can hover over elements, click to reveal additional
information, and adjust parameters in real time to see how different
variables influence outcomes.

**Application:**\
Excellent for websites, educational tools, and data journalism. This
method is perfect for exploring complex datasets where users need
control over what they want to see.

**Example:**\
A web tool where users can explore the effects of different factors
(e.g., age, gender, education) on job satisfaction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7. Maps and Geospatial Visualizations

**Concept:**\
Data visualized on maps can be incredibly powerful, especially when
geographic context is essential to the story. These visuals can show
patterns across different locations, reveal relationships between data
and place, and help identify regional trends.

**Application:**\
Used in public health (tracking disease outbreaks), environmental
research (tracking deforestation), and social science (mapping crime
rates).

**Example:**\
A heatmap showing the spread of a disease outbreak, highlighting areas
of high infection rates over time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 8. Narrated Data

**Concept:**\
Narrated data takes storytelling a step further by adding voiceovers or
text to guide the viewer through the visualization, ensuring that key
points are not missed and context is clearly explained.

**Application:**\
Ideal for educational content, presentations, and documentaries where
understanding the deeper meaning behind the data is essential.

**Example:**\
A video presentation explaining the impact of climate change, with data
visualizations narrated by an expert who explains each trend.

## **Introduction to Data Visualization**

-   **What is Data Visualization?**
    -   Definition: The graphical representation of data to find
        insights, patterns, and trends.
    -   Importance: Simplifying complex data, making research more
        accessible, and aiding in decision-making.

## **Introduction to Data Visualization**

-   **Why is it Important for Psychologists?**
    -   For Self: Making sense of information.
    -   Outwards: Presenting results to a wider audience (academics,
        professionals, the public).

## **The Goals of Data Visualization**

-   **Communication of Information**
    -   Making data accessible, clear, and engaging.
    -   Translating raw numbers into understandable narratives.
-   **Pattern Recognition**
    -   Identifying trends, outliers, and relationships.
    -   Supporting statistical analysis by visually highlighting key
        elements.
-   **Exploration**
    -   Using visuals to explore and understand datasets during the
        research process.

## **Types of Data**

-   **Categorical Data**
    -   Nominal (e.g., types of therapy, animal species)
    -   Ordinal (e.g., Likert scales, levels of education)
-   **Continuous Data**
    -   Interval (e.g., temperature, time of day)
    -   Ratio (e.g., height, reaction time)
-   **Discrete vs Continuous**
    -   The difference between countable categories and measurements
        with infinite possible values.

## **Common Types of Graphs and When to Use Them**

-   **Bar Charts**
    -   Best for comparing discrete categories.
    -   Example: Comparing the number of participants in different
        experimental groups.
-   **Histograms**
    -   Useful for visualizing the distribution of continuous data.
    -   Example: Showing the frequency distribution of test scores.
-   **Pie Charts**
    -   Use for displaying proportions of a whole, though less
        frequently used in scientific contexts.
-   **Line Graphs**
    -   Great for showing trends over time or continuous data
        relationships.
    -   Example: Reaction time changes over time.
-   **Scatterplots**
    -   Ideal for representing relationships between two continuous
        variables.
    -   Example: Relationship between stress levels and performance.
-   **Boxplots**
    -   Excellent for summarizing the distribution, central tendency,
        and variability of continuous data.
-   **Heatmaps and Density Plots**
    -   Useful for visualizing large, complex datasets, or relationships
        between multiple variables.
-   **Violin Plots**
    -   Combines boxplot and density information to visualize data
        distribution.

## **The Many Ways to Convey Information** 1

-   **Tables**
    -   When to use: Presenting precise numerical data or categorical
        comparisons.
-   **Infographics**
    -   A visual story: Combining graphs, icons, and minimal text to
        tell a narrative (good for public dissemination).

## **The Many Ways to Convey Information** 2

-   **Interactive Visualizations**
    -   Dynamic data representations, useful for exploring and filtering
        datasets in real-time (tools like Shiny or Tableau).
-   **Dashboards**
    -   Overviewing multiple aspects of data in one space for
        decision-making, often used in applied settings.

## **The Many Ways to Convey Information** 3

-   **Flowcharts and Diagrams**
    -   Best for depicting processes or causal relationships.
-   **Presenting Visuals in Scientific Reports**
    -   Adapting visuals to APA standards (formatting, labeling, figure
        legends).

## **Design Principles for Effective Data Visualizations**

-   **Clarity and Simplicity**
    -   Avoid unnecessary elements (e.g., chartjunk, 3D effects).
    -   Focus on the key message and make the visualization intuitive to
        interpret.
-   **Consistency**
    -   Use consistent colors, fonts, and labels across different
        graphs.
-   **Labeling and Annotations**
    -   Clear axis titles, units, and legends to make the graph
        self-explanatory.
-   **Color Choices**
    -   Consider color blindness (red-green blindness common) and use
        color schemes that enhance readability.
-   **Appropriate Scale**
    -   Avoid misleading visuals by ensuring that scales are not
        exaggerated or compressed.
-   **Hierarchy and Focus**
    -   Guide the viewer’s attention to the most important parts of the
        graph (using size, bolding, or contrasting colors).
-   **Telling a Story**
    -   Visuals should flow logically and lead the reader through the
        narrative of your data.

## **How to Choose the Right Graph for Your Data**

-   **Understanding Your Audience**
    -   Tailor complexity based on who is consuming the data (public,
        peers, experts).
-   **Data-Driven Decision Making**
    -   Choose the graph based on the data structure and the key message
        you want to convey.
-   **Avoid Common Pitfalls**
    -   Misleading graphs (incorrect scales, truncated axes) can
        misinform rather than clarify.
    -   Overcomplicating simple messages with too many visual elements
        or excessive detail.

## **Psychological Aspects of Data Visualization**

-   **Cognitive Load**
    -   Minimizing mental effort required to interpret visuals.
-   **Gestalt Principles of Perception**
    -   How humans perceive visual elements (e.g., proximity,
        similarity, closure) and how to leverage these in visual design.
-   **Emotional Impact of Visuals**
    -   Using visual design to invoke emotions (e.g., empathy, urgency),
        particularly in health or social psychology data.

## **Examples and Case Studies**

-   **Good vs Bad Visualizations**
    -   Comparing effective vs poorly designed graphs.
    -   Examples from psychological research where data visualizations
        impacted understanding.
-   **Interactive Exercise**
    -   Students create their own data visualization using sample
        datasets (e.g., reaction times, Likert scale responses).

## **Conclusion**

-   Recap of key points: Visualization enhances comprehension,
    facilitates communication, and uncovers hidden patterns in data.
-   Encouragement: Practice visualizing data in R or Excel using real
    datasets.

## Uncovering Truths

-   Curiosity
-   Questions
-   Measurements
-   Data
-   Tools
-   Creativity
-   Hard-thinking

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Welcome to University!

-   You've had an exciting first week.
-   The big question of Well-being:
    -   What is it?
    -   How do you measure it?
    -   How do we increase it?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Positive Psychology

-   Using the power of your mind to achieve positive things.
-   And now, you've got me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction

-   I'll take these first two lectures, labs, and data skills sessions.
-   We'll explore life outcomes, well-being, success, happiness, and
    Positive Psychology.
-   We'll dive into Positive Research Methods.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Big Setup

-   One day, you'll want to change a mind, capture interest, persuade,
    convince, or motivate.
-   It could be an idea, a product, a pitch, or even a truth.
-   I want you to be ready for that moment.
-   Practice now on ideas and data that aren't life-changing... yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## A World of Ideas

-   The world is your repertoire.
-   This is a psychology module, but let's avoid talking about
    psychology today.
-   Let's avoid numbers too!
-   And most importantly, let's avoid being boring.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

-   Who said that?\
-   \[Pause for class participation\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decision Making

-   What do I want to communicate?
-   What's the best way to communicate that?\
-   Is it risky?\
-   Should I talk, show, demonstrate?
-   Should I pretend to be an expert or show my failures?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## This Week & Next: Data Visualisation

-   Data Visualisation I & II.
-   **Did I inspire wonder?**
    -   What if I had chosen a different title?
        -   Truth, Beauty, and Power
        -   Seeing is Believing: The Power of Data Visualization in
            Psychology
        -   From Data to Drama: The Art of Psychological Storytelling

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## End Visualisation

-   People don't like to be shown where they are; they like to see the
    destination.
-   Disneyland: "15 miles" vs "Only 15 minutes!"
-   Shampoo: "For Frizzy, Dry Hair" vs "Smooth n' Sleek"
-   Are you derivative, boring, 'grey' or will you **Think Different**?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Positive Research Methods

-   **Marcus Aurelius**: "Master your mind, accept your fate, and act
    with virtue."
-   **Aristotle**: "Live a balanced life guided by reason, virtue, and
    the pursuit of flourishing."
-   **Jagger**: "You can't always get what you want, but sometimes you
    get what you need."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dream Big

-   Do you have a dream?
-   Do you **need** a dream?

## **Why Visualize Data?**

-   Visuals help us **perceive patterns** and **relationships** between
    variables.

-   In psychology, this is critical when studying associations like:

    -   Age and cognition

    -   Stress and health

-   A well-designed graph can uncover insights missed by **numerical
    summaries** alone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Cognitive Bias and Visualization**

-   Graphs tap into human **visual perception**: how we process shapes,
    contrasts, and relationships.

-   But be cautious! Our perception can also **mislead**:

    -   **Outliers** can skew interpretations.

    -   Complex designs (like 3D graphs) can distort reality.

-   Example: Anscombe’s Quartet — same statistics, but radically
    different scatterplots.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Visual Tasks in Psychology**

-   In psychology, we often ask questions like:

    -   **Is there a pattern?**

    -   **Is there a correlation?**

-   Scatterplots, bar charts, and line graphs help us **visually
    decode** relationships faster than raw data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Designing Honest Graphs**

-   The aim is to **present data truthfully**:

    -   Avoid chartjunk or misleading embellishments.

    -   Keep the focus on the **data**, not the decoration.

-   In psychology, we need clarity to avoid **misleading
    conclusions** about human behavior and cognition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Perception and Human Cognition**

-   Our minds tend to **group visual data** (Gestalt principles).

    -   This can help but also mislead.

-   Example: **Stacked bar charts** can obscure individual trends within
    groups.

    -   Be mindful of what you're trying to communicate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Plato’s Triad: The True, The Good, and The Beautiful**

Plato believed in the intrinsic connection between **truth**,
**goodness**, and **beauty** — a concept that has influenced Western
thought for centuries.

For Plato, these three qualities are inseparable in the realm of
**Forms**.

The **truth** is inherently **good**, and what is **good** is also
inherently **beautiful**.

Thus, if something is **false**, it cannot be truly **beautiful** or
**good**.
